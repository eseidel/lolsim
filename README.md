[![Build Status -](https://travis-ci.org/eseidel/lolsim.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eseidel/lolsim)

Toy implementation of League of Legends' combat engine.

Current patch: 7.24.1.

My goal here is to familiarize myself with the finer details of LOL's rules as
well as have a chance to play around with Dart.

It's difficult to imagine this ever being perfect simulation, in part because
Riot does not make all of their rule values public (e.g. attack-windup,
ability-durations, etc.) but also because keeping up with LOL would be a huge
task.

## Setup
Need a copy of [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/install).
Run `dart bin/precache_dragondata.dart` to download the necessary files from [Riot's static data](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/static-data).

## Usage
There are many entry points into the simulation used to answer different questions.
Examples incude:
 - `dart bin/duel.dart -v examples/duel.yaml` -- Used for testing groups of champs/mobs/items against one another.
 - `dart bin/round_robin.dart` -- Used for testing all champ pairs against one another.
 - `dart bin/dps.dart` -- Show various champs ranked by lvl 1 dps.
 - `dart bin/burst.dart` -- Show various champs ranked by lvl 3 burst.

There are several other dart files in bin/, most of them are for testing.

## Limitations
Many.  Including at least:
 - Champion/Item/Rune lookups are case sensitive and expect names in Title Case.
 - Incomplete (and partially outdated) support for Runes.
 - Very limited item support.
 - Very limited abilities support.
 - Limited support for Buffs.
 - No CC.
 - Minmal AOE or support for location or proximity.
 - Limited monsters.

## Questions to answer:
- Jungle clear-time approximations.
- Range catagories for each stats (high, med, low)
- Guestimate as to power ranges of various champs
- When are various items (liandries, BOTRK, etc.) worth it?
- How Burst scales?
- DPS and burst for each champ.

## TODO / Bugs
- Handle stat modifying buffs first, before other buffs.
- Monster leveling
- Monsters are not neutral / incorrect AI.
- Improved proximity.
- Coverage & coveralls.io
- Split mob.dart into smaller files.
- Add more passives, abilities, runes, etc.
- Convert to integer math (ticks, etc.) to avoid double precision errors.
- Implement in-combat/out-of-combat
 -- More champs would die to darius and twitch dots.
 -- Needed for Crest of Cinders healing.
- Use round_robin json to compare lists.
- Auto-attack windup.
- Missle system & proximity.
- Neutral teams logic (do not attack until attacked, and attack as a group).
- Missing Krugs split timers.
- Krugs and Gromp Experiance on first clear.
- Healing Amp (Runic Armor, Spirit Visage, etc.)
- OnHit should not be included in lifesteal.
- Spells with duration (e.g. consume) vs. auto-attack durations.


## Passives missing affecting the lvl 1 round_robin sort.
- Aatrox passive (complicated, likely requires bloodthirst to be useful)
- Akali passive (CDR interaction? Second hit on a static 4s cooldown?)
- Ashe passive (semi-complicated crit replacement) and Q
- Blitzcrank passive (needs mana and shields)
- Braum passive (needs stuns)
- Caitlyn passive (crit modifier)
- Camille passive (requires shields)
- Elise passive (ai to really use it)
- Fizz passive (unclear how to implement this kind of dmg reduction)
- Graves AA modifier and passive (impactful, hard to implement)
- Gangplank passive (small effect, needs bonus ad split)
- Kayle passive (needs percent armor mod)
- Kha'Zix passive (on-hit, small effect, with abilities bigger)
- Kled passive (very complicated, needs non-targetable)
- Malphite passive (needs shields)
- Miss Fortune passive (on hit, small effect)
- Nautalis passive (needs stun)
- Nocturn passive (aoe, unclear how best to do dmg-modified autos)
- Pantheon passive (needs blocked)
- Taric passive (needs an ability to be useful)
- Wukong passive (needs proximity)
- Sejuani passive (easy)

Plan for stuns?
- Stuns should cancel AA windups, but not AA missiles?
- Stuns prevent new AA windups during duration.

## Abilities affecting round_robin / clear_times
- Alistar Trample (needs stuns)
- Ivern W brushmaker passive
- Jinx Q passive
- Rammus W ball curl
- Teemo E passive
- Udyr all of his abilities
- Vayne W passive
- Sejuani E Permafrost
- Nunu Q consume
